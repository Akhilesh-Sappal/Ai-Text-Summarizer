# AI Text Summarizer ⚡️

An easy-to-use Python app that uses AI to summarize long text into concise, readable summaries.

---

## 🧩 Features

- Input plain text or files and get a short summary  
- Supports both **bullet‑point** and **paragraph** formats  
- Lightweight and fast—process text in seconds  
- Clean, user-friendly interface  

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or newer  
- Virtual environment (recommended)  
- (If using external AI model/API) API key from provider (e.g. OpenAI GPT)  

---

## ⚙️ Setup

1. 💾 **Clone the repo**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Akhilesh-Sappal/Ai-Text-Summarizer.git
   cd Ai-Text-Summarizer
   ```

2. 🧪 **Create virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows
   ```

3. 📦 **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. 🔑 **(Optional) Add API key**

   If you're using an API (e.g. OpenAI), add your key:

   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"    # macOS/Linux
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here         # Windows
   ```

---

## 🚀 Usage

```bash
python main.py --input "My file.txt" --format bullets
```

Or, for direct input:

```bash
python main.py --text "Paste your long text here" --format paragraph
```

You can modify the format (`bullets` or `paragraph`) as per your preference.

## ℹ️ How it works

At its core, the script:
1. Loads your input text or file  
2. Sends it to an AI model (locally hosted or via API)  
3. Receives and displays a concise summary  

(Adjust details here based on whether you use GPT, HuggingFace model, etc.)

## 📄 Example

**Input**:
> "Artificial intelligence (AI) is intelligence demonstrated by machines. Leading AI textbooks define the field as..."

**Output (bullets)**:
- AI represents machine-based intelligence  
- Major models and breakthroughs have advanced AI capabilities  
- Applications include healthcare, finance, and automation
